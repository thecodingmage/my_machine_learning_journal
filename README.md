Welcome to my personal learning repository where I document everything I learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This includes notes, projects, resources, and experiments that help me grow as an aspiring ML engineer.

This repository serves the following purposes:

- To track my progress as I learn and apply concepts in machine learning and deep learning.
- To organize notes, code, and resources in one place.
- To document the challenges I face and how I overcome them.
- To build a portfolio of small and large ML/DL projects.
- To reflect regularly on what Iâ€™ve learned and plan next steps.
